          <p class="lead">Get Rails Migrations Right</p>

          <p>You never sweat as hard as when you hit &quot;enter&quot;
          on &quot;rake db:migrate&quot; on your prod data. Line for
          line, no other code in Rails is as
	  likely to destroy your users' data. Or get you fired.</p>

	  <p>How often has a migration locked a big table, causing an
	  hour of unexpected downtime? Or been fine in development,
	  then died mid-deploy in production and you're suddenly
	  sweating bullets and typing SQL on your production server,
	  trying desperately to fix it at 2am?</p>

	  <p>A migration combines all the stress of raw SQL (<i><small>did I forget an
	  important 'where' clause? Is my join wrong?</small></i>) with code you
	  can't easily test. Every migration <i><b>starts</b></i> as
	  weird dodgy legacy code.
	  </p>

	  <p>The more uptime you need, the worse migrations get. Want
	  to drop a column? Want to be sure that ActiveRecord isn't
	  ever using it? Good luck with that. Rolling deploys?
	  Everything gets harder.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Wouldn't it be great if migrations were just more code? If
	  you could easily do good code reviews, and you knew
	  Rails' weird hidden problems around migrations? If you could
	  just do no-downtime deploys and rolling deploys without the
	  slightest bit of fear?
	  </p>

	  <p> <b>No More Lost Data</b> is here for you. It has
	  procedures to catch your migration bugs early, including
	  difficult <b>bugs with performance and production data</b>. Code
	  review guidelines, checklists, recipes for difficult
	  operations... It's all there.
	  </p>

	  <p> Better yet, it explains <i>why</i> in great detail. Not
	  every migration needs "DefCon 4" procedures. The best is to
	  know <i>when</i> you need to worry and how to get rid of as
	  much of it as possible. Fix your problems in staging, in
	  code review, or by avoiding difficult situations entirely.
	  A little experienced advice can go a long way.

          <h2> By This Author... </h2>

	  <p> <b>No More Lost Data</b> is by Noah Gibbs, author of
	  Rebuilding Rails. Noah has presented at the Golden Gate
	  Ruby Conference, taught Ruby on Rails at Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Silicon Valley campus for their MSE program.</p>

	  <p>Rebuilding Rails has been used at the University of
	  Washington, several different Rails bootcamps and Satish Talimâ€™s
	  RubyLearning.com class. It has also been the subject of Ruby conference
	  presentations by Guille Carlos and Nishant Modak.</p>

	  <blockquote><p>What drew my attention to your book was that [&hellip;] I'm the type of developer that likes to know how things tick at a very deep level.  The guy who messed with Assembler but knew he didn't have to. I'm not a huge fan of magic when itcomes to programming for the fact that when you get into trouble with code or find yourself in a complex edge case, or even a bug, knowing more about what's going on "behind the scenes" is very helpful.</p><footer><strong>Kirk Quesnelle</strong></footer></blockquote>

	  <blockquote><p>I found your book there a while back and
	  finally over Christmas I've had some time to work through
	  it. It's satisfying a whole load of curiosities that I had
          and I'm learning and clarifying a lot of things. In fact, I'm like a
          kid in a candy store. It's so nice to be spoon fed this info as it's a
          lot of work to dig it out all by oneself.</p>

	  <p>This book is for people running sites with data you care
	  about. Often your customers' data.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>You're a professional Rails programmer? You know that every
	    lost engineer hour costs your company around $100? It's for you.</li>
	    <li>You're running a busy site, and worried about data loss and
	    slow migrations? For you.</li>
	    <li>Need to understand the tradeoff between migration
	    complexity and downtime? For you.</li>
	    <li>Need code review guidelines for migrations? Definitely for you.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Alternately...</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Just learning Rails? Don't know the basics of
	    migrations? Not for you. <a
	    href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html"
	    target="_blank">Read the Rails Guide</a>, it's
	    awesome.</li>
	    <li>You don't mind spending many hours experimenting and reading blog posts for
	    the same info? Not for you. </li>
	    <li>Don't care about site downtime during deploys?
	    Probably not for you.</li>
	    <li>Just running a development site for yourself? Probably not
	    for you.</li>
