          <h2> By This Author... </h2>

	  <p> <b>No More Lost Data</b> is by Noah Gibbs, author of
	  Rebuilding Rails. Noah has presented at the Golden Gate
	  Ruby Conference, taught Ruby on Rails at Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Silicon Valley campus for their MSE program.</p>

	  <p>Rebuilding Rails has been used at the University of
	  Washington, several different Rails bootcamps and Satish Talimâ€™s
	  RubyLearning.com class. It has also been the subject of Ruby conference
	  presentations by Guille Carlos and Nishant Modak.</p>

	  <blockquote><p>What drew my attention to your book was that [&hellip;] I'm the type of developer that likes to know how things tick at a very deep level.  The guy who messed with Assembler but knew he didn't have to. I'm not a huge fan of magic when itcomes to programming for the fact that when you get into trouble with code or find yourself in a complex edge case, or even a bug, knowing more about what's going on "behind the scenes" is very helpful.</p><footer><strong>Kirk Quesnelle</strong></footer></blockquote>

	  <blockquote><p>I found your book there a while back and
	  finally over Christmas I've had some time to work through
	  it. It's satisfying a whole load of curiosities that I had
          and I'm learning and clarifying a lot of things. In fact, I'm like a
          kid in a candy store. It's so nice to be spoon fed this info as it's a
          lot of work to dig it out all by oneself.</p>

          <h2>Is "No More Lost Data" For You?</h2>

	  <p>This book is for people running sites with data you care
	  about. Often your customers' data.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>You're a professional Rails programmer and know that every
	    lost engineer hour costs your company around $100? It's for you.</li>
	    <li>Running a busy site, and worried about data loss and
	    slow migrations? For you.</li>
	    <li>Need to understand the tradeoff between migration
	    complexity and downtime? For you.</li>
	    <li>Writing code review guidelines for migrations on a
	    team of professional programmers? Definitely for you.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Alternately...</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Just learning Rails and don't know the basics of
	    migrations? Not for you. <a
	    href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html"
	    target="_blank">Read the Rails Guide</a>, it's
	    awesome.</li>
	    <li>Don't mind spending many hours experimenting and reading blog posts for
	    the same info? Not for you. </li>
	    <li>Don't care about site downtime during maintenance?
	    Probably not for you.</li>
	    <li>Just running a development site for yourself? Probably not
	    for you.</li>
